# Daily life English

## 2023-09-10

this is first time, i realize English is such important for me.

i joined the current company manulife last year,that is a big financial company, my main work is about funds, includes fund subscription, fund redemption, basically, every aspect of fund tranding.

in my last job, i am only a frontend engineer, after joined manulife, i became a full stack software engineer, u know, that is more valuable experience, because, i can  control full lifestyle for software,so,yup, i am happy for here.

but,i know i cannot stop my study， i woule leave the company one day in the future, at that time, i need master more work skills than what i do now,

after i thought about deeply, it is english, yes,the most language spoken in this word.

i think that is very important for every sofetware engineer, the code is wrote by English in this world,from ths side, i should study it , but, u know, most time we used translation tools to get the world what i want, after joined manulife, sometimes, I need to communicate with my foreign colleagues in **English**，that time, i know i should have a better English level, i can get foreign job when i have better English skills,so ,yes, that is why i wrote daily note in English.
