### ðŸŒ± What is PawHaven
A Open-source platform for rescuing stray animals: report sightings, join rescues, multi-language support, responsive UI & mobile support

- Use my dev skills to help communities and stray animals.  
- Create tools that are accessible (multi-language, mobile friendly) and maintainable.  
- Share what I learn: from technical challenges to design & UX.

- Writing more about my full-stack experience to help more technologists.
